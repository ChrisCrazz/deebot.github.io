                        Beaglebone: A quick Guide to GPIO Subsystem</h1>

                </header>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    GPIO subsystem is a very important subsystem that allows the users to interface the board with
                    sensors
                    and other peripherals and allow interaction with real world.Pocket Beagle and Beaglebone black are
                    the
                    two most popular variants among the enthusiasts. Both of which have AM335X at its
                    heat and 2 PRU which operate at 200MHz. On the Pocketbeagle the SIP that you see is by octavo
                    systems,
                    which integrates TI’s AM335X and several other components like LDO, PMIC on a single SIP. IN fact it
                    is
                    this integration which has made the current form factor of pocket beagle possible , further it also
                    leads to faster and quicker
                    development and production time if I would like to prototype on pocketbeagle and then create
                    my own custom board around OSD335X.In this post I will try to declutter the GPIO subsytem. I am using following variant of Linux </br>
			Linux beaglebone 4.19.94-ti-r42 #1buster SMP PREEMPT Tue Mar 31 19:38:29 UTC 2020 armv7l GNU/Linux
                </p>
                <h3>Inside the GPIO Subsystem</h3>
                <p>
                    In the AM335X there are 4 GPIO modules where each module supports 32 GPIO pins. So in total there
                    are 128 GPIOs . However not all 128 GPIOs are available on the Beaglebone varients. The actual
                    number
                    depends on the variant that you will use.On a beaglebone Black you have 2 Expansion headers P8 and
                    P9 respectively
                    which have 46 pins on each of them. ON P8 one can use 44 GPIO, Pin 1 and 2 are used for ground
                    purposes and on the P9 only 23 pins can be used as GPIO.Similarly on the Pocketbeagle you have P1
                    and P2 expension
                    headers which have 36 pins each. However 18 pins on P1 and 27 on P2 can be configured in GPIO mode
                </p>
                <p>
                    The figure below shows different columns that you will find in Expension Header section of
                    System Reference Manual. There is a SRM document for each Beaglebone Black and Pocket Beagle.For
                    more details one
                    can go through the <a
                        href="https://github.com/beagleboard/beaglebone-black/wiki/System-Reference-Manual#70-connectors">
                        <b>SRM LINK</b> </a>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/expension.PNG" alt="" /></div>

                <ul>
                    <li>PIN column is the pin number on the expansion header.</li>
                    <li>The PROC column is the pin number on the processor.Further there is a document called
                        Technical Reference Manual (TRM) which can be accessed <a
                            href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/am3352.pdf">
                            <b>HERE</b> </a>. On the page no 10 of this document you can see that the SOC is physically
                        divided
                        into 3 section and each pad can be located by combination of column name and row number.</li>
                    <li>The Name column tells the default mode of the pin on poweron rest. However you can see the pin
                        configured as in some other mode out of the box that might be due to the fact that a device tree
                        overlay has altered it.</li>
                    <li> The MODE columns are the mode setting for each pin. Setting each mode to align with the mode
                        column will give that function on that pin. The mode 7 is the mode in which the pins can
                        behaiave as general purpose input output.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3> Conversion into Software Friendly naming Convention</h3>
                <p> In the image above which is taken from SRM, you would have noticed that the GPIOs are represented
                    using a special convention, for example gpio1[2].This denotes that the pin is the 2nd pin of gpio
                    module 1. But the
                    kernel doesnot use this convention. So we need to know the corresponding number for this GPIO that
                    the kernal would understand.
                    In order to convert. Use the following algorithum <br>
                    gpio1[2] = 1* 32 +2 = gpio34 <br>
                    gpio0[4]= 0*32 + 4 = gpio 4<br>
                    The entry corresponding to each pin can be found in the /sys/class/gpio directory as shown in the
                    figure below
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/GPIODIREC.png" alt="" /></div>

                </p>
                <h3>Mode configuration for GPIO</h3>
                There is a register that controls the mode configuration settings for each pin. The control module
                register section in the TRM explains it thoroughly.The PAD/PIN configurtion register starts at address
                044E1800H(Base address(0x44E1000H) + 800H). The table below explains
                the mode configurations.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/Modes.png" alt="" /></div>


                </p>
                <p>
                <h3>Details of Directory which corresponds to Pad configuration
                    Registers</h3>
                The sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux-pinctrl-single directory contains information about the
                configuration of pins as shown in the figure below.

                <div class="image main"><img src="images/directoryreg.png" alt="" /></div>
                On investigating further using the cat pins |more command one can see corresponding topins there is a
                hex value for example for pin0 there is a hex value 00000027 which denotes that the pin is in
                mode 7. Please note that the pin numbers you see here for example pin0 , pin1 here in the image above
                donot corresponds to the numbers as shown in the expansion header table we saw in the SRM. These
                register address as shown above for example 44e10800 can be helpful in locating the pin modes in the dts
                files. Further when you run this commandyou can have a different default mode on your board if it is
                configured differently in the dts file which is loaded on boot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further You can also see if a pin is already claimed by sub system by running following command as
                    shown in the image
                    inside the syskernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux-pinctrl-single directory.You should be very
                    clearful
                    in dealing with the pins which are already claimed.
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/claim.png" alt="" /></div>
                Once we narrow down on a unclaimed pin we and before we configure it according
                to our need, we might be intrested to know the current mode in which the pin is configured
                Lets take an example
                lets say you are looking for a pin to use as GPIO and you run the command as shown in the figure above
                and findout that pin10 Iis unclaimed.You can see that pin10 is pin 1_34 on my expansion header and is in
                default mode. Now the next immediate point of investigation isto know what is its default mode. To know
                this one can run the following command
                cat pins | grep "pin 10"
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/defaultmode.png" alt="" /></div>
                So as you can see the pin 10 is already in the GPIO mode so we dont need to reconfigure the mode.
                <p>

                    Pin Groups <br>
                    Certain pins can belong to a perticular group, for example the mmc pins can be grouped in a group to
                    know the groups one can do.<br>
                    cat pingroups | more<br>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/defaultmode.png" alt="" /></div>
                </p>

                <h3>User LEDs and controlling them through sysfs</h3>

                The SRM tells us that the user LEDs are actually connected as below.

                <div class="image main"><img src="images/userled.png" alt="" /></div>
                You can control these LEDs and assign them different operations like blink after a delay, heartbeat
                pattern, blink when the memory card is accessed etc.The entry for each userLED can be seen in the
                following directory as shown in the figure. Further if you cat the trigger, we can see the different
                settings for UserLEDs. The currently active setting is shown inside the brackets. For <example
                    heartbeat=""></example>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/userleddir.png" alt="" /></div>
                In order to activate a configuration you can do echo "hearbeat"> trigger or echo "none" > triggger to
                turn it off.
                Similarly you can set these LEDs to perform different tasks.
                </p>
