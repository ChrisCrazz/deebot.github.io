                    While using a pocket beagle you would quickly realise that you would need access to internet
                    connection
                    on it. But since it doesnot have a wifi chip onboard nor does it have a ethernet RJ45 port . You are
                    need to go extra mile to get the internet working. You have with two solutions. First one is to add
                    a physical hardware USB as shown below, attach a wifi dongle and use connman commands as in
                    beaglewireless

                    This picture is originally posted by Jason Kridner and you can access the thread here.
                    <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/beagleboard/c/GOwSuY4oiyI" style="color:rgba(255,0,0,0.5);">
                        here</a>
                    The other method is to make the laptop to which your pocketbeagle is connected as the default
                    gateway to
                    route all the traffic. The posts I saw so far used some iptable commands to configure the IP tables.
                    However as I was trying to get internet for me working , my mentor pointed me to something called
                    nm-connection-editor, which I think is a cleaner way to configure internet. In this post I am
                    sharing the steps.

                </p>

                <p>
                    After connecting my pocket beagle I see the following interfaces along the IP addresses when I do
                    "ifconfig" on my ubuntu 18.04.1
                <ul>
                    <li>enx985dadd7619f - 192.168.7.1</li>
                    <li>enx985dadd76la1 – 192.168.6.1</li>
                    <li>wlplso – 192.168.1.78</li>
                </ul>

                On runing ifconfig on my pocket I get following interfaces and corresponding IP
                <ul>
                    <li> usb0 -- 192.168.7.2</li>
                    <li> usb1 --192.168.6.2 </li>
                </ul>

                I am sharing these so that you can corelate with your IP address on your interfaces. After doing
                this run "nm-connection-editor" You should see a window like shown below.
                </p>
                <div class="image"><img src="images/nmconn1.png" alt="" width=400></div>
                <p>



                    I clicked on the + button onthe buttom left and
                    added the wired connection 2. Here I changed the method to “shared to other computers” and added the
                    IP
                    address and subnet as shown below.
                </p>
                <div class="image"><img src="images/nmcon2.png" alt="" width=400></div>

                <p>

                    Then on my pocketbeagle I ran the following command to set my laptop as default gateway for
                    pocketbeagle

                    <code>sbin/route add default gw 192.168.7.1</code> </br>


                    Now if you run the "route" command you should see the following output.</br>
                <div class="image"><img src="images/nm3.png" alt="" width=400></div> </br>

                Finally you need to run the following command
                <code>sudo dhclient usb1</code>

                This final step need to be run everytime you reebot and you would have access to internet.
